# 12 day program "Milestone project" (Day-4 & Day-5 action items)

## What was your motivation?
This project prepared me to data science fellowship bootcamp for a good start

## What problem does it solve?
The project is about Value of Energy Cost Saving Program for businesses in New York City.
### The questions addressed: 
- How many different companies are represented in the data set?
- What is the total number of jobs created for businesses in Queens?
- How many different unique email domains names are there in the data set?
- Considering only NTAs with at least 5 listed businesses, what is the average total savings and the total jobs created for each NTA?

## What did you learn?
The project performed the following operations and allowed me to consolidate the main python tools before the bootcamp program.

- How to read data from a CSV (comma-separated value) file to create a DataFrame.
- How to filter data in a DataFrame.
- How to compute summary statistics for a DataFrame.
- How to use the groupby method to aggregate data.
- How to dump results of analysis to a CSV file.

Using the same data set and results that:
- create a scatter plot of jobs created versus average savings. Use both a standard and a logarithmic scale for the average savings.
- histogram of the log of the average total savings.
- line plot of the total jobs created for each month.
